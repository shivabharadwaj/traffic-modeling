Game Theory provides powerful theoretic models for analyzing transportation systems.
In this project, we investigate the social dilemma between short-term self-interest and long-term
collective well-being while traveling on a transportation network. Using the two main theories
describing traffic flow networks (S tatic Traffic Assignment (STA) vs. Dynamic Traffic Assignment
(DTA) ), we present the problem of Lane Switching from a game-theoretic point of view. We
introduce an algorithm that uses Best Response Dynamics to compute the pure-strategy Nash
equilibrium of a sample transportation network where all agents are selfish and
non-coordinating. Using an integer optimization problem, we compute the socially optimal
solution minimizing the cost objective function, and finally, we calculate the Price of Anarchy of
this transportation network.
